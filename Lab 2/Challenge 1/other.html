		<h1>What about the Author haven't you told me?</h1>
		<p>Theres more to a person than just what they do, such as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Colin is a huge fan of board games, and hopes to work in the industry eventually.</li>
			<li>Colin has Autism, which is not immediately obvious due to many years of practicing social masking.</li>
			<li>Colin's dog is a Border Collie mixed with some giant thing, we're not entirely sure it's even still 100% dog...</li>
			<li>Colin's favourite musical artists are Stornoway, and he attended their last ever show in Scotland</li>
		</ul>
